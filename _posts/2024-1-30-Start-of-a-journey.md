title: Start of a journey
---

Welcome to my, Zweanslord's, blog about the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io/) game. I am a programmer by trade, who likes science fiction. I would like to embark on a journey with SpaceTraders, setting up a hobby project. This will also be personal challenge, where I seek to achieve the following principles:

- **Document** my progress here on this blog, with explanation of what I'm doing! That's both a practise of doing documentation, as well as hopefully helping future me figure what I was doing, if future me ever plans to look back.
- **Experiment** and try out new things! Or well, new for me anyway. Developments in programming follow rapidly, and what I once thought was the way to go can well be surpassed by new developments. That and it's a nice chance to get some practise in programming language which aren't the one I program most in at work, which would be Java, so you should see no Java here!
- **Share** by making something that works while committing regularly, to github. No keeping a local program and not sharing, like I did the first time I saw SpaceTraders API, and only shared images of what I made on the SpaceTraders API discord.

I have no idea where this journey will take me, how fast I will go and how long my fuel will last, but I will find out in time. Along the way, I will set and adjust goals to deliver.

- First off is this blog, where the next blog post will detail how I quickly set it up.
- Next up is making a webpage where anybody can register an agent for SpaceTraders, which is hosted on github pages.

SpaceTraders API is a game where players can manage a spaceship, and by trading they can earn money and buy more spaceships. Classical science fiction strategy, but the catch here is that there is no user interface. There is a documented API, [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), where a computer program can interact with the game. As it lacks a graphical user interface and I want to flex my css skills, one of my first goals is to create a web based user interface.

Others player have made graphical user interfaces with 3d graphics for SpaceTraders API, have made dashboards to analyse data and have automated their ships and agents to trade by themselves without, or little, user input. Each two weeks, the galaxy is reset, so everybody starts anew, but this time with whatever insight or update to their programs they have made last time.

My own ambition may be smaller than that, but nevertheless I want to make the graphical user interface for registering an agent look:
- **Futuristic**
- **Fancy**!
