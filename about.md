In this little space of the internet you can find my blog about the personal challenge I am undertaking with the game [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io/), a game where only an API is available and the players can use their programming skills to interact with a digital galaxy far away. While players can manage a fleet of spaceships, my personal challenge are whatever goals I set myself at a time. As I program for a living, I see this game as an opportunity to also play around. Still, I would like to put to the test the following goals, for as long as this challenge holds my interest:

- **Document** my progress here on this blog, with explanation of what I'm doing! That's both a practise of doing documentation, as well as hopefully helping future me figure what I was doing, if future me ever plans to look back.
- **Experiment** and try out new things! Or well, new for me anyway. Developments in programming follow rapidly, and what I once thought was the way to go can well be surpassed by new developments. That and it's a nice chance to get some practise in programming language which aren't the one I program most in at work, which would be Java, so you should see no Java here!
- **Share** by making something that works while committing regularly, to github. No keeping a local program and not sharing, like I did the first time I saw SpaceTraders API, and only shared images of what I made on the SpaceTraders API.

If you are reading this blog, I hope you find some use of it.

Either way, I wish you a nice day!
